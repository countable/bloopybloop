Introduction
------------
To directly tap into hardware acceleration, we need to setup a 3D rendering pipeline. Of course, we can still do 2D as
well by using planes, but the technology under the hood is for 3D.
To do this, we feed the graphics card specifically crafted pieces of code it can digest. These pieces are called
**shaders**. Shaders are always written in a special [shader language].
It looks a bit like C, but with powerful syntax for processing structures with multiple components&mdash;such as colors.
So, what exactly happens when we render?
First, we are given a chance to manipulate our 3D model with a **vertex shader**. The name comes from the corners
of a model being called vertices (singular "vertex"). Most commonly you would apply a matrix transformation, or two, to
render your model in the correct place. You can read more about matrices in 3D programming from plenty of sources.
The second step we can do, is assigning a **fragment shader** (also sometimes referred to as a pixel shader).
A fragment shaders allows us to run the same code for every single pixel visible. The vertex shader can pass values to
the pixel shader, such as the current xy-position on the surface of the model being rendered. This way we can know which
pixel of the texture image to use when rendering.
You have to have both of these shaders, but fortunately the simplest form for each is only a few lines. In this
example the shader are embedded to the HTML page as script blocks of a specific type, but you could as well load them
from a text file with ajax, or to write them inline as a JavaScript string. WebGL will never know where the code came
from.
This example will be a single HTML page, with no external dependencies.

Vertex shader (operates on 3D models)
-------------------------------------
Of our two shaders, let's start with the vertex shader, as it is processed first in the WebGL rendering chain.
Vertex shader is a function, which is executed on every vertex (corner point) of the 3D model being rendered. A vertex
goes in, and a modifies vertex comes out. This does not affect the original model, but is performed anew each time we
render.
Here you would do all kinds of transformations on the 3D model. Usually this would involve rotating and scaling the
model around its own origin, and then moving it to the correct position in the final 3D world. The matrix "transform"
contains all necessary information to do this. You can google more about matrix transformations, they are a heavily
covered topic in mathematics.
Notice that the type of the script block is arbitrary; it is treated as pure text.
-->
<script id="vs-shader" type="x-shader/x-vertex">
    // Position on the surface of the model.
    attribute vec4 position;
    // Entry point for shader is always the method main.
    // It does not return anything, nor does it take arguments.
    void main(void) {
    // Assigning a value to gl_Position is this the vertex shader's way of returning a value.
    gl_Position = position;
    }
</script>

<!--
Fragment shader (operates on pixels)
------------------------------------
If you are wondering about all the keywords, here is a quick list of what the ones before variables mean.
  - attribute: a value WebGL gives to us.
  - varying: shader across shaders and can be modified.
  - uniform: assignable from **outside** of WebGL. In our case can be set from JS.
-->
<script id="fs-shader" type="x-shader/x-fragment">
    // Some boilerplate code; just include it.
    #ifdef GL_ES
    precision highp float;
    #endif
    // Texture we want to use.
    uniform sampler2D tex0;
    // System absolute milliseconds passed from JavaScript.
    uniform float time;
    // Screen size in pixels.
    uniform vec2 resolution;
    // Absolute mouse position.
    uniform vec2 mouse;
    // Entry point for all shaders.
    void main(void)
    {
    // Flip the y-coordinate, as WebGL thinks the origin is at bottom left corner.
    vec2 coord = vec2(gl_FragCoord.x,resolution.y-gl_FragCoord.y);
    // Vector from mouse position to this pixel.
    vec2 delta = vec2(coord.x-mouse.x,coord.y-mouse.y);
    // Save distance from mouse position.
    float distance = length(delta);
    // Normalized delta.
    vec2 deltaNormal = delta/distance;
    // WebGL considers the texture to be from (0,0) to (1,1), so we need to calculate
    // this coordinate from the pixel coordinates we have.
    vec2 uv = coord.xy/resolution.xy;
    // Distort the texture coordinate to create a ripple effect.
    uv += deltaNormal*sin(distance*.025-time*4.0)*.025;
    // Retrieve the texture pixel at the right location.
    vec3 col = texture2D(tex0,uv).xyz;
    // Apply some lighting effects depending on the distance from mouse; this
    // simply multiplies all components of the colors, making ones closer brighter,
    // and the ones further away darker. The circle that stays unmodified is of radius 50px.
    col *= 100.0/distance;
    // Return the color in the result variable gl_FragColor.
    gl_FragColor = vec4(col,1.0);
    }

     * The code that runs around the shaders
     * -------------------------------------
     *
     * The shaders need to provided with the necessary information from JavaScript.
     * They cannot directly access any code outside of their own block.
     *
     * You can give the shaders your custom input in **uniforms**. These are shared
     * between the shaders in the same program/chain, and there can be any number of them
     * of varying types. "uniform1f" sets one variable of type "float" in the shader code.
     * "uniform2f" sets a "vec2", which is a vector of two floats. However, "uniform1i"
     * does something different; it takes in a slot number for a texture, and sets a
     * corresponding sampler to the shader. You can see how it works in the code below.
     *
     * To set the uniforms, you have supple a parameter called "location", which
     * tells WebGL into variable of which name you want to put this value.
     *
     * For more info, try to go through the original [OpenGL glUniform docs], even if they
     * are not so straight-forward and are written for C. Please let me know if you find
     * actual docs for uniforms in WebGL specifically :)
